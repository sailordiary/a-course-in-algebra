# A Course in Algebra/ 《代数教程》
## Review from Amazon.com
* "This is a masterly textbook on basic algebra. It is, at the same time, demanding and down-to-earth, challenging and user-friendly, abstract and concrete, concise and comprehensible, and above all extremely educating, inspiring and enlightening." - _Zentralblatt MATH_

* "Great book! The author's teaching experience shows in every chapter." - _E. Zelmanov, University of California, San Diego_

* "Vinberg has written an algebra book that is excellent, both as a classroom text or for self-study. It starts with the most basic concepts and builds in orderly fashion to moderately advanced topics ... Well motivated examples help the student ... to master the material thoroughly, and exercises test one's growing skill in addition to covering useful auxiliary facts ... years of teaching abstract algebra have enabled Vinberg to say the right thing at the right time." - _Irving Kaplansky, MSRI_
